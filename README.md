# SHRUG Villages to Lok Sabha Constituencies Mapping

## Overview

This repository contains a dataset mapping SHRUG (Socioeconomic High-resolution Rural-Urban Geographic) villages to Lok Sabha constituencies along with electoral data from the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections. This mapping enables researchers to analyze electoral outcomes at a granular village level.

## Methodology

The mapping process employed a weighted spatial merge approach due to the small size of individual SHRUG villages. A direct match to constituency shapefiles would result in numerous spurious merges. Instead, the following procedure was implemented:

1. SHRUG villages were first matched to higher administrative shapefile levels (subdistricts)
2. These subdistricts were then matched to parliamentary constituencies
3. A spatial merge was performed for all SHRUG villages where 80% or more of the village area falls within a parliamentary constituency

## Known Issues and Limitations

While this approach significantly reduces erroneous matches, there are still some errors on the border between two parliamentary constituencies. However, I have run other diagnostic tests and these errors seem to be minute, but I am still figuring out how to resolve them and am open to suggestions to improve this.

**Important Note**: Since SHRUG only contains data for rural India, 22 parliamentary constituencies that are entirely urban are not included in this election dataset.
