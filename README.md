# Shrid to Lok Sabha Constituency Mapper

This project maps shrid villages to Lok Sabha constituencies using a weighted spatial merge technique. Due to the small size of individual shrid villages, a direct merge with the constituency shapefile tends to produce spurious results. Instead, this project uses a higher administrative shapefile (subdistrict) to first match with parliamentary constituencies, followed by a spatial merge for all shrid villages where at least 80% of the area falls under a given parliamentary constituency (PC).

## Methodology

- **Weighted Spatial Merge**:  
  - Direct matching of shrid villages to constituency shapefiles often leads to numerous spurious merges because the villages are very small.  
  - To improve the accuracy, a higher administrative shapefile (subdistrict level) was used to map to the parliamentary constituencies.  
  - A spatial merge is then performed on the shrid villages that have a majority (â‰¥80%) of their area falling within a specific parliamentary constituency.

- **Diagnostic Testing**:  
  - Additional diagnostic tests have been run to identify potential errors, particularly along the borders between two PCs.  
  - While minor errors remain along these borders, they appear to be minimal. Efforts to further resolve these issues are ongoing.
